# SimpleRoleBot

## What is it?
So, you ever had a discord server where you need to give users permissions to give out roles,
but you do not want to grant them too many permissions? You give them `Manage roles` and they
can feel free to delete or edit permissions on any role that want to. How's that for lack of
security... SimpleRoleBot aims to eliminate this problem entirely by only allowing certain
roles (by configurating their roles with roleIDs in the config.yml) to add and remove roles to
users. You can also dictate what roles a certain role can add/remove to others. 

## How to set it up
Coming soon...
